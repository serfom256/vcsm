## This is the very simple version control system

### Supported commands:

---

- init vcsm root in the current directory
- commit - commits the current state of the path
- rollback - rollback to commit by the commit hash
- lc(list of commits) - get list of all commits

---
This version control system doesn't commit the content of files (committed only the file path)
